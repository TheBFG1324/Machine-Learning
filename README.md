# Machine Learning Classwork  

## Overview

In my Machine Learning class, I worked on a diverse set of assignments, applying and evaluating a wide range of machine learning models and techniques. These projects focused on both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, as well as reinforcement learning.

## Key Projects and Techniques

### Supervised Learning:
- **Regression Models**: Linear and Polynomial Regression
- **Classification Algorithms**: 
  - Naïve Bayes  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Random Forests  
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)  

### Unsupervised Learning:
- **Clustering Algorithms**:  
  - k-means  
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
  - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)  

### Other Techniques:
- **Feature Reduction**: PCA, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms  
- **Resampling Techniques**: Addressed imbalanced datasets using various methods.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented Q-Learning and SARSA.  

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python Programming**  
- Libraries:  
  - Scipy  
  - Numpy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Scikit-learn  

## Datasets and Focus

- Worked extensively with the **Iris dataset**.  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **confusion matrices** and **accuracy**.
